## Project Overview
This project analyzes why real meat products significantly outperform alternative meats in sales. By studying factors like packaging, cooking instructions, regional availability, and product popularity, we identify drivers of purchasing behavior and offer strategic recommendations to increase alternative meat revenue for Conagra Brands.

----

## Hypothesis
"If we create similar purchase experiences for real and alternative meat products, revenue from alternative meats will increase."

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- Grouped data by Product UPC to create product-level features  
- Engineered new variables capturing geographic effects  
- Removed multicollinear variables and non-significant features using Chi-Square and correlation tests  
- Standardized numeric data and encoded categorical variables  
- Train-test split applied to ensure model validity  

### Modeling
- Forward Selection Regression to identify ranked drivers  
- Random Forest Regression with hyperparameter tuning  
  - Final model performance: **R² ≈ 0.81**

## Limitations

- Lower observation count in some alternative meat segments may limit generalizability  
- Correlation-based insights; further experimentation is needed to establish causality
